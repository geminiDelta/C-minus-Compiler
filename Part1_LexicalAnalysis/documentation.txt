1.1	-	Overview
The lexical analyzer uses a flagging system for flow control. There is a dictionairy of flags for letters, numbers, symbols, whitespace, and for errors. Starting with the first line, the analyzer reads a character and decides which type of flag it should raise. The active flag designates a path to be taken to derive the next token based on the subsequent characters. The active flag is then lowered and another is raised based on the next character.
