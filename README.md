# C-minus-Compiler
A compiler for the fictional language C minus written in Python.

This is a 4 part project which I developed for my Construction of Language Translators course durring my last semester as an undergradutae. Each subsequent part builds upon the previous: Lexical Analysis -> Syntax Analysis -> Semantic Analysis -> Intermediate Code Generation(as 4-tuples). This project involved studying and correcting a Context Free Grammar (CFG) to make it LL(1) recursive descent parsable.
